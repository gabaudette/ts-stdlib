# ts-stdlib

A modern TypeScript standard library designed to fill the gaps in the native language toolkit. 
It provides well-tested, type-safe utilities, algorithms, data structures, and mathematical
helpers that make TypeScript development faster, safer, and more

## Features

- ðŸš€ Productivity-focused: Reduce boilerplate with ready-to-use utilities
- ðŸ”’ Type-safe by design: Leverages TypeScriptâ€™s type system for safer code
- ðŸ“¦ Modular & tree-shakeable: Import only what you need, no extra bloat
- ðŸ“š Broad coverage: Algorithms, data structures, math, string manipulation, and more

## Packages

#### Algorithms
Practical and experimental algorithms implemented with type safety.
- [Documentation](./packages/algorithms/docs)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ts-standard-library/algorithms)
- 
#### Core
Foundational helpers and utilities that show up in almost every Typescript project.
- [Documentation](./packages/core/docs)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ts-standard-library/core)

#### Data structures
Efficient, generic, and reusable implementations of classic data structures.
- [Documentation](./packages/algorithms/data-structures)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ts-standard-library/data-structures)

#### Mathematics
A versatile math module that goes beyond the basics, with support for areas like algebra, geometry, trigonometry, vectors, matrices, statistics, and probability. 
Itâ€™s not a full-fledged math engine, but itâ€™s a solid foundation for most basic to advance computational needs.
